VPN Setup and Privacy Protection Report
Objective
Demonstrate how to identify and remove suspicious browser extensions, understand the role of VPNs in securing privacy and communication, and document the setup and verification of a reputable free VPN client.

1. VPN Selection and Sign Up
Two reputable free VPN services were considered: ProtonVPN (free tier) and Windscribe (free tier). ProtonVPN was selected due to its strong privacy reputation and genuinely free service with no bandwidth limits.

Account Creation:

Registered on the official ProtonVPN website using a valid email address.

Chose the “Free” plan.

2. Downloading and Installing ProtonVPN Client
Navigated to the official ProtonVPN downloads page.

Downloaded the app for Windows.

Installed the application following on-screen prompts.

3. Connecting to a VPN Server
Opened ProtonVPN and logged in.

Selected a free VPN server (for example, “Netherlands Free #1” – usually the closest or least busy server is optimal).

Clicked “Connect” and waited for the connection confirmation.

4. Verifying IP Address Change
Before connecting:

Accessed [whatismyipaddress.com] to note the real/public IP address.

After VPN connection:

Refreshed the page to confirm the IP address had changed to reflect the VPN server’s location.

5. Confirming Encrypted Traffic
Browsed various websites (including https-secured sites).

Checked for “Secure”/“Lock” icon in the browser’s address bar, confirming HTTPS encryption.

Used tools like [ipleak.net] to verify DNS leak protection.

6. Disconnecting and Comparing Browsing Performance
Disconnected the VPN via the app’s interface.

Noted IP address reverted to the original.

Browsing speed comparison:

Noticed slight reduction in speed while connected to VPN (expected for free tier).

Browsing functionality and streaming largely unaffected for general use.

7. VPN Encryption and Privacy Features (Research)
Encryption: ProtonVPN uses strong AES-256 encryption for tunnelled traffic—an industry standard.

Privacy:

No logging of user traffic or connection activities.

Kill switch feature that disconnects internet if VPN drops.

DNS leak protection.

Limitations (free tier):

Fewer server locations.

Speeds may be throttled during peak usage.

No access to advanced features (e.g. Secure Core, P2P) on free plans.

8. Screenshot Evidence
(In a real report, a screenshot of the VPN app showing “Connected” status, and of the browser displaying the changed IP at whatismyipaddress.com, would be inserted here.)

9. Summary: VPN Benefits and Limitations
Benefits
Enhanced Privacy: Masks real IP address, helping anonymize user activity.

Secure Communication: Encrypts internet traffic, protecting sensitive data on public Wi-Fi and untrusted networks.

Bypass Restrictions: Allows access to geo-restricted content.

Protection from Surveillance: Limits tracking by ISPs and potential eavesdroppers.

Limitations
Speed Reduction: Free versions may have slower speeds or data limits.

Limited Servers: Restricted locations on free plans compared to paid services.

No Absolute Anonymity: No VPN can guarantee 100% anonymity or immunity from advanced tracking or targeted attacks.

Trust in Provider: Users must trust the VPN provider’s privacy policies and technical implementation.

Conclusion
Using a reputable free VPN like ProtonVPN is an effective step toward improving online privacy and security, especially when combined with vigilant browser hygiene (removal of suspicious extensions). However, users must understand the limitations, including speed and feature constraints, and remain selective about which VPN provider they trust with their traffic.
